# Boa Entrega - Logistics System based in Microservices Architecture
Proof of concept for the course Distributed Software Architecture - PUC Minas

A microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

## Language, frameworks and patterns adopted
- .NET 6
- Microservices Architecture
- Domain Driven Design
- Repository Patterns
- CQRS
- PostgreSql
- Docker containers
- RabbitMQ for Message Queue
- Kong Api Gateway
- Richardson Maturity Model- Level 2

## How to run?
This project is based on Docker-Compose. If you want to run it just type on your favorite console:

```
docker-compose up
```
